             <li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is GMS?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The Gates Millennium Scholars (GMS) Program, funded by a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, was established in 1999 to provide outstanding African American, American Indian/Alaska Native*, Asian Pacific Islander American**, and Hispanic American students with an opportunity to complete an undergraduate college education in any discipline area of interest. Continuing Gates Millennium Scholars may request funding for a graduate degree program in one of the following discipline areas: computer science, education, engineering, library science, mathematics, public health or science. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
            <li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When should I apply for the GMS?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>You should apply for the GMS scholarship during your senior year of high school. If you have a GED or if you have never attended college before and will be entering as an incoming freshman in the fall. </p> <br>
                    <p>You should start planning well before the January due date. A lot of students begin writing the summer before the scholarship.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->

            <li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the GMS Application Process? </a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The application process for the GMS scholarship is a three-part effort: </p> <br>
                      <p>  1) a Student Application is completed and submitted by the student. </p><br>
                       <p> 2) a Nominator Form must be completed and submitted by an educator- Principal, teacher, guidance counselor or higher education representative. </p><br>
                       <p> 3) a Recommender Form must be completed and submitted by any adult who is familiar with the student’s community service and leadership activities, such as a supervisor at work or a community leader. If the person who serves as a Nominator is also familiar with the student’s non-academic activities, he or she may serve as a Recommender as well. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the Registration ID?  ?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The student's registration identification number is a combination of his/her five digit zip code and the last four digits of his/her preferred phone number. For example, if the student’s five digit zip code is 99999 and preferred phone number is 703-555-1234, then the registration identification number would be 99999-1234. Students should select one telephone number to use for their registration identification number to prevent any possible confusion. </p> <br>
                        
                       <p> As the student, your registration identification number is automatically displayed by the system as you complete page one of the online application. The educator writing about your academic record (Nominator) and the individual writing about your community service and leadership activities (Recommender) will have to enter your student registration identification number to access their forms. Individuals writing about your academic record (Nominator) and community service and leadership activities (Recommender) do not have to wait for you (Nominee) to start their evaluation. Just ensure that they enter the correct student registration identification number. All three forms are linked by the student's registration identification number.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Pell Grant Eligibility</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If selected as GMS finalists, students must demonstrate eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant Program as part of their financial aid package for the 2015 academic year. Students must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to the U.S. Department of Education, Federal Student Aid Programs. Students are urged to file a 2015 FAFSA at their earliest opportunity. The 2015 FAFSA form will be available January 1, 2015 at www.fafsa.gov. Federal Pell Grants typically are awarded to families that demonstrate significant financial need. Eligibility for a Federal Pell Grant is a function of many factors, including dependency status, family income, family size and the number of students in the family.</p><br>

<p>To determine if a student is Pell Grant eligible, he/she and the parent(s)/guardian(s) should meet with a high school counselor or the financial aid officer at the college or university he/she plans to attend.
For more information, visit <a href="www.fafsa.gov" target="_blank">www.fafsa.gov</a>. </p><br>
                    
                    <p>You can get a rough estimate of your aid eligibility <a href="http://www.finaid.org/calculators/quickefc.phtml" target="_blank">here</a>
                    </p><br>
                        
<p style="color:black;">Note: Students should not submit a FAFSA with the GMS application. GMS does not have a school code that a student can use on their FAFSA. If a student is selected as a finalist, GMS will request that he/she send a copy of his/her Student Aid Report (SAR) to the GMS office. We recommend students set a target date of February 14, 2015 to submit the FAFSA online at www.fafsa.gov.</p>
